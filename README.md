# QR Subdomain Search

Quick and dirty scripts I wrote for brute-force searching for subdomains. Based on the [Nayuki QR code generator libraries](https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library).

Unfortunately it's not very user friendly, and I don't particularly plan to make it user friendly either.
